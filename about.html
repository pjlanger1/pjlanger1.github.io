                transit ventures is a new york city-based non-profit organization dedicated to
                bridging the gap between mass transit policy-makers and policy stakeholders using 
                open data and an open-source analytics development philosophy.
              
                our mission is to improve social outcomes through research on public transit infrastructure use,
                with a special interest in ecologically sustainable micromobility solutions.
