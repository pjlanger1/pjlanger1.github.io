        <p>yep... we're back. not exactly transit policy related, but definitely public interest and public data related: we're seeing the election cycle turn once more.</p>
        <p>agonizingly few journalists and pundits care to contextualize numbers related to polling data as they clumsily wield words like <strong>'margin of error'</strong> to get you to shut your brain off and be scared. </p>
        <p><strong>so what is a margin of error?</strong></p>
        <p>a margin of error qualifies an estimate.  for instance, if you took a poll and 52% of your respondents liked candidate A over candidate B (implying 48% prefer candidate B), there is a 4 point spread between candidates A and B (52-49 = 4)</p>
